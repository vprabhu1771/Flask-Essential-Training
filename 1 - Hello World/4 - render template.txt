To return an HTML file like `index.html` in a Flask app, you can use Flask's built-in functionality for rendering templates. Here are the steps:

1. Create a folder in your project directory (let's call it "templates") to store your HTML templates.

2. Put your `index.html` file inside the "templates" folder.

3. In your `app.py`, import the `render_template` function from Flask:

  
   from flask import Flask, render_template
   

4. Modify your route to render the `index.html` file:


   @app.route('/')
   def hello_world():
       return render_template('index.html')
   

5. Now, Flask will automatically look for the `index.html` file in the "templates" folder and render it when you access the root URL.

Your Flask app will return the content of `index.html` when you access its root URL (http://127.0.0.1:5000/ if you're running it locally). Make sure you have the proper file structure in place for Flask to find your templates.
