Here are the steps:

1. Install Flask: If you haven't already, you'll need to install Flask. You can do this using pip, a Python package manager. Open your terminal and run:

   
   pip install Flask
   

2. Create a Flask App: Create a new directory for your Flask app, and within that directory, create a Python file, e.g., `app.py`.

3. Import Flask: In `app.py`, import Flask and create an instance of the Flask app:


   from flask import Flask

   app = Flask(__name__)
   

4. Create a Route: Define a route in your app. This is how you'll handle different URLs. For example:


   @app.route('/')
   def hello_world():
       return 'Hello, World!'
   

5. Run the App: At the end of your `app.py`, add the following lines to run the app:


   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run()
   

6. Start the Development Server: In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing `app.py` and run:

   
   python app.py
   

   This will start the development server, and you can access your app at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

That's a basic setup for a Flask app. You can add more routes, templates, and functionality as needed for your project. Don't forget to install any additional packages you might require, like a database connector if your app needs one.
